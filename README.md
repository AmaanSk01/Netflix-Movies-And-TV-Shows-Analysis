Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project was to analyses Netflix content to uncover patterns and trends in the types of shows and movies available on the platform. By leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the goal was to clean the raw data, conduct a thorough analysis, and present the findings visually using Power BI. Additionally, the project aimed to explore relationships between different variables, such as content type, release year, country of origin, and genre, to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

Data Analysis Processing:
The data analysis process involved several stages, beginning with data cleaning. This was done using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, where libraries such as pandas and NumPy were employed to handle missing values, standardize formats, and filter out irrelevant records.
Once the data was cleaned, the analysis moved to Power BI for visualization. Here, various charts and graphs were created to showcase key insights. For example, bar charts were used to illustrate the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows), while line charts tracked trends in content release over time. Geographical maps highlighted the concentration of content production in different countries.
This stage of the project emphasized the importance of visualization in making complex data more accessible and actionable. Power BI's interactive features allowed stakeholders to explore the data from multiple perspectives, ensuring that the findings were both comprehensive and engaging.

Scope:
The scope of this project extends beyond a simple analysis of Netflix content. It includes exploring relationships between various content attributes, such as the correlation between release year and genre popularity, or the impact of certain directors or actors on viewership trends.
The project also emphasizes the role of data visualization in communicating complex findings effectively. By utilizing Power BI, this analysis becomes not just a backend data process but a front-end tool for decision-makers in the industry.
The project’s scope can also be expanded in the future to include deeper analyses, such as predictive modelling to forecast content trends or sentiment analysis on user reviews to gauge audience reactions to different types of content.

Algorithm Used in Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)
The recommendation system in this project is built using a Content-Based Filtering approach that leverages TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity. TF-IDF is a technique used to convert textual data—specifically, the titles of Netflix shows and movies—into numerical vectors by assigning higher importance to unique words and reducing the weight of common ones. Cosine Similarity is then applied to measure the angle between these vectors, effectively quantifying how similar two titles are based on their word composition. By combining these techniques, the system identifies and recommends titles that are textually similar to a given input title, optionally filtered by a rating threshold to ensure quality. This algorithm is effective for suggesting content with similar themes or contexts based on title relevance, making it a practical solution for media recommendation tasks.

PowerBI:
Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that enables users to visualize data, create interactive dashboards, and derive insights through easy-to-understand charts and reports. In this project, Power BI was used extensively to present the results of the Netflix data analysis in a visually compelling and interactive format. After cleaning and transforming the dataset using Python, key insights such as genre distribution, content type proportions, country-wise content production, rating trends, and top-performing titles were visualized using various chart types including bar charts, donut charts, maps, line graphs, and area charts. These visualizations allowed for a deeper understanding of Netflix’s global content landscape, helping identify regional preferences, content trends over time, and viewer engagement patterns. The use of Power BI added clarity and accessibility to the data, making the findings easy to interpret for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
